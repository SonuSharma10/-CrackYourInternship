# My DSA Progress

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a compilation of my journey through learning and mastering DSA concepts. The codes are organized into folders for easy navigation and understanding.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Practice Folder**

This folder contains my practice codes for various DSA concepts. It includes solutions to common problems, algorithm implementations, and exploratory coding exercises. These codes serve as the foundation of my learning process.

### 2. **LeetCode Folder**

This folder includes all the solutions I have attempted on LeetCode, categorized for better organization:

- **Future Folders:** As I solve more problems, new folders will be added for other topics like Strings, Trees, Graphs, etc.

## How to Use

1. **Practice Folder:**

   - Navigate to this folder to explore foundational concepts and problem-solving techniques.

2. **LeetCode Folder:**
   - Browse through subfolders to find solutions for specific topics.
   - Each code is written with clarity and contains comments to explain the approach.

## Contributions

This repository is a personal project, but I welcome constructive feedback and suggestions. If you find any errors or have improvements in mind, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I am continuously learning and improving my skills. Thanks to platforms like LeetCode and various online resources that have helped me grow.

### My Snippet
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
 
int main(){
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
 
    ll i,j,k,t,n,m,f,q;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> n;
        vector<ll> arr(n);
        for(ll i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> arr[i];
 
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```
